    h2 What is Beetbox?
    p A VM for local L*MP development, built with Packer, Vagrant + Ansible
    p Beetbox is essentially a pre-provisioned version of&nbsp;
      a(href='http://www.drupalvm.com/') Drupal VM
      |  mainly to speed up initial virtual machine build time, but also to reduce the size of each VM by leveraging&nbsp;
      a(href='https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vagrant-1-8.html') linked clones
      | .
    p Whilst it contains a set of default feature configuration, it is extremely extensible and almost anything can be overridden/extended with a simple YAML config file.
    p It is designed to have an instance (VM) per project and be integrated into a VCS like git, so that configuration can be easily shared within a team and a setup of a new project should be as simple as&nbsp;
      kbd git clone ...; vagrant up
      | .
    p This particular project contains the plumbing to manage the automated build of the pre-provisioned Vagrant base box, so almost all functionality is provided by ansible roles external to this project.
    h3 What's different about this project?
    ul
      li It's a composer plugin which automatically creates a Vagrantfile.
      li You only add config to your project and don't need to manage a fork of the whole provisioning system.
      li It uses a pre-provisioned base box so itâ€™s much faster to provision.
      li Each new version of the box gets published to Atlas only if all roles are provisioned making the box always stable.
      li With linked clones each VM is a small clone of a single master.
      li You can reuse the same provisioning system for a CI environment.
      li Minimal host machine dependencies.
